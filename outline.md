# Outline

## Why
- demo where lm fails
- vs 'outliers'
- vs transformation fail

## Introduce with standard polynomial
- where works
- where overfits
- where isn't applicable/fails

## Introduce GAM

## Interpretation

## Extensions
- smooths


## Technicals
- penalized regression
- choice of smooth
- choice/estimation of df

## Ties to other
- Random effects
- GP
- Boosting/RF
- Spatial
