# Preface

~ Nature abhors the linear.

This talk/workshop provides a brief introduction to <span class="emph">generalized additive models</span>, or GAMs, or even more generally STARs, or <span class="emph">structured additive regression</span> models.  They offer a natural extension to common generalized linear models, while having the flexibility to incorporate a wide range of modeling situations.


## Outline

##### Why

- demo where lm fails
    - vs traditional ways of dealing with problems that arise

##### Transition: standard polynomial

- where works
- where isn't applicable/fails

##### Introducing GAMs

- basic info
- getting started

##### Issues

- things to get used to

##### Extensions & Ties to other

- smooths
- Random effects
- GP
- Boosting/RF
- Spatial


##### Technicals

- by-hand example
- penalized regression




## Prerequisites

Prerequisites include some experience with using R for statistical modeling, and of firm understanding of linear regression and exposure to generalized linear models.
