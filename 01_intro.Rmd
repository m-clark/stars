# Preface

~ Nature abhors the linear.

This talk/workshop provides a brief introduction to <span class="emph">generalized additive models</span>, or GAMs, or even more generally STARs, or <span class="emph">structured additive regression</span> models.  They offer a natural extension to common generalized linear models, while having the flexibility to incorporate a wide range of modeling situations.

## Audience

Specifically, I have in mind applied researchers with a burgeoning interest in using models they probably weren't exposed to in their applied statistical training. More generally, anyone that finds it useful.  

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites include a firm understanding of linear regression and exposure to generalized linear models.  Some experience with using R for statistical modeling is required to follow along with the code and do the exercises. The workshop will potentially see a wide range of skill sets and modeling experience among attendees, but aims to be accessible to all.  As such, the practical is favored over the technical, but some details are provided as an appendix, with additional references for those interested in going deeper down the rabbit hole.


## Outline
