# Preface

~ Nature abhors the linear.

This talk/workshop provides a brief introduction to <span class="emph">generalized additive models</span>, or GAMs, or even more generally STARs, or <span class="emph">structured additive regression</span> models.  They offer a natural extension to common generallized linear models, while having the flexibility to incorporate a wide range of modeling situations.


## Outline

##### Why
- demo where lm fails
    - vs traditional ways of dealing with problems that arise

##### Segue: standard polynomial
- where works
- where overfits
- where isn't applicable/fails

##### Introduce GAM

##### Interpretation

##### Issues

##### Extensions
- smooths


##### Technicals
- penalized regression
- choice of smooth
- choice/estimation of df

##### Ties to other
- Random effects
- GP
- Boosting/RF
- Spatial

##### Other
- Case example
- Running GAMs in R
- Underlying details
- Extensions
- Connections



## Prerequisites

Prerequisites include some experience with using R for statistical modeling, and of firm understanding of linear regression and exposure to generalized linear models.
