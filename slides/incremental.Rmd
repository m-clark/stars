# Three ways to build incremental slides

In remark.js, you may use

--

- two dashes

--

- layout slides

--

- template slides

---

# Two dashes

The easiest way to build incremental slides is...
--
 to use two dashes `--` to separate content on a slide.

--

You can divide a slide in _any way you want_.

--

- One bullet

- Another bullet

--

- And one more

# Layout slides

---

### What is a layout slide

A layout slide (with the slide property `layout: true`) is good for a series of slides that share some common elements, such as the top-level heading.

---

### It is hidden behind the scenes

The layout slide itself is not displayed. It is only used as the base to build latter slides.

---

### Slide properties are inheritted

Most slide properties are inheritted from the layout slide, such as `class`. You can override or add more properties, such as `background-image`.

---

### Stop the layout

To stop the layout slide, use the property `layout: false` on the next slide.

---
layout: false

# Template slides

The methods "two dashes" and "layout slides" are automatic, and good for consecutive pages of slides. If you need more control, you may use the more explicit method. That is, template slides.

A template slide should be named, so that you can refer to this template on another slide.

---
name: karl-yolo
class: inverse, bottom
background-image: url(`r xaringan:::karl`)
background-size: contain

# Define a template

This slide is named `karl-yolo`, with a few properties (`class` and `background-image`).

Use the property `template: karl-yolo` on other slides to use this template.

---

# A slide that does not use the template

Nothing here. I didn't use any template for this slide.

---
template: karl-yolo

### A slide that uses the karl-yolo template

Everything was inheritted from the template. The content of this slide was appended to the template slide.

---
name: template-placeholder

# Placeholders in template slides

{{content}}

If you want a new slide to be embedded in a particular position on a template slide, you can insert `{{content}}` as a placeholder in the template.

This slide has a placeholder and was named `template-placeholder`.

---
template: template-placeholder
class: inverse

### Let's use the placeholder template now!

template: karl-yolo

### I'm using the karl-yolo template one more time just in case you want to see Karl again!

# Conclusion
